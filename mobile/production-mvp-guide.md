# JunkStop MVP - Complete Production Setup

## Overview
This is now a complete, production-ready MVP with:
- Real Firebase authentication and cloud storage
- PostgreSQL database backend with REST API
- OpenRouter AI integration for smart coaching
- Push notifications system
- Full data persistence and sync
- Production deployment configuration

## Architecture

### Frontend (React Native + Expo)
- **Authentication**: Firebase Auth with real email/password
- **Data Storage**: Firebase Firestore + local AsyncStorage fallback
- **Photo Storage**: Firebase Storage with automatic upload
- **AI Integration**: OpenRouter API with enhanced fallback responses
- **Notifications**: Expo Notifications with daily reminders and streak celebrations
- **Navigation**: Bottom tabs with modal settings screen

### Backend (Express.js + PostgreSQL)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **API Endpoints**: RESTful API for user management and data sync
- **Authentication**: Session-based auth with user validation
- **File Upload**: Integration with Firebase Storage
- **Statistics**: Real-time analytics and progress tracking

## Production Features Implemented

- Automatic session management
- Profile editing and management
- Secure user data isolation

### 2. Cloud Data Persistence
- Firebase Firestore for real-time data sync
- Automatic photo upload to Firebase Storage
- Local AsyncStorage as fallback
- Data backup and restore capabilities

### 3. AI Coaching Integration
- OpenRouter API integration with fallback system
- Context-aware motivational messages
- Pattern recognition for personalized advice
- Enhanced local responses when API unavailable

### 4. Push Notifications
- Daily reminder notifications
- Streak milestone celebrations
- Customizable notification preferences
- Cross-platform notification support

### 5. Backend API
- Complete REST API for data management
- PostgreSQL database with proper schema
- User authentication and authorization
- Statistics and analytics endpoints

## Environment Setup

### Required API Keys
```bash
# Firebase (required for production)
EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_firebase_api_key
EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_project.firebaseapp.com
EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_project.appspot.com
EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=123456789
EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=1:123456789:web:abcdef123456

# OpenRouter AI (optional - app works without it)
EXPO_PUBLIC_OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_openrouter_api_key

# Database (for backend API)
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@host:port/database
```

### Firebase Setup Steps
1. Create Firebase project at https://console.firebase.google.com
2. Enable Authentication with Email/Password
3. Create Firestore database
4. Enable Storage
5. Add configuration to environment variables

### OpenRouter Setup Steps
1. Create account at https://openrouter.ai
2. Generate API key
3. Add to environment variables
4. App automatically falls back to enhanced local responses if unavailable

## Deployment Options

### Option 1: Expo Application Services (EAS)
```bash
npm install -g @expo/cli eas-cli
eas login
eas build --platform all
eas submit --platform all
```

### Option 2: Manual Build
```bash
# iOS
eas build --platform ios --local
# Android
eas build --platform android --local
```

### Backend Deployment
```bash
# Deploy to Railway, Heroku, or similar
git push heroku main
# Or use Vercel for serverless
vercel --prod
```
