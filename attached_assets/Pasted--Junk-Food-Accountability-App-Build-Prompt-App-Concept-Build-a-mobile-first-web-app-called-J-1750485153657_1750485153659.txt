# Junk Food Accountability App - Build Prompt

## App Concept
Build a mobile-first web app called "JunkStop" that helps users break their junk food addiction through shame-based accountability, streak tracking, and social motivation. Unlike generic food trackers, this focuses specifically on stopping bad eating habits through psychological triggers.

## Core Features to Build

### 1. Photo Logging System
- **Camera Integration**: Users can take photos of junk food they're about to eat or just ate
- **Quick Rating System**: After each photo, rate on scale 1-10:
  - How guilty do you feel? (1 = no guilt, 10 = extremely guilty)
  - How much do you regret this? (1 = no regret, 10 = complete regret)
- **Timestamp & Location**: Auto-capture when/where the junk food was consumed
- **Photo Gallery**: Scrollable timeline of all junk food photos (their "wall of shame")

### 2. Streak Tracking System
- **Clean Days Counter**: Big prominent counter showing "X days since last junk food"
- **Streak History**: Show previous streaks and best streak achieved
- **Streak Killer**: When they log junk food, dramatically show "STREAK BROKEN" with sad animation
- **Recovery Mode**: After breaking streak, show "Get back on track" motivation

### 3. Shame-to-Pride Dashboard
- **Weekly Shame Score**: Calculate average guilt/regret ratings for the week
- **Monthly Progress**: Visual chart showing improvement (or lack thereof)
- **Money Wasted Calculator**: 
  - Let users input estimated cost of junk food
  - Show running total of money wasted
  - "You could have bought X instead" comparisons
- **Health Impact Visualizer**: Simple metrics like "estimated calories from junk food this month"

### 4. Social Accountability Features
- **Accountability Partner**: 
  - Invite one friend/family member
  - They get notifications when you log junk food
  - They can send encouraging/disappointed messages
- **Anonymous Confession Board**: 
  - Community feed where users can post their worst junk food moments
  - Other users can react with support or tough love comments
- **Weekly Report Sharing**: Auto-generate shareable image of your week's performance

### 5. Smart Notifications & Triggers
- **Craving Time Alerts**: Learn user's patterns and send warnings during high-risk times
- **Location-Based Warnings**: "You're near [fast food place] - remember your goals!"
- **Motivational Reminders**: Daily quotes about breaking bad habits
- **Streak Celebration**: Celebrate milestone days (7, 14, 30, 60, 100 days clean)

### 6. Gamification Elements
- **Achievement Badges**: 
  - "First Week Clean"
  - "Resisted Temptation 10 Times"
  - "Lowest Guilt Score of the Month"
  - "Accountability Partner MVP"
- **Levels System**: Progress from "Junk Food Addict" → "Getting Better" → "Clean Eater" → "Junk Food Warrior"
- **Leaderboard**: Compare streaks with friends (optional)

### AI Integration Setup
```javascript

  const response = await fetch('https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${OPENROUTER_API_KEY}`,
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      model: "meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:free", // Free tier
      messages: [
        {
          role: "system", 
          content: "You are a tough-love junk food addiction coach. Be direct but supportive."
        },
        {
          role: "user", 
          content: `User has eaten junk food ${userPattern.frequency} times this week. Their guilt average is ${userPattern.avgGuilt}/10. Generate a personalized motivation message.`
        }
      ]
    })
  });
  return response.json();
};
```

### Database Schema (simplified)
```
Users: id, email, name, streak_count, best_streak, total_guilt_score, accountability_partner_id, ai_coaching_enabled
JunkFoodLogs: id, user_id, photo_url, guilt_rating, regret_rating, estimated_cost, estimated_calories, location, timestamp, food_type
Achievements: id, user_id, badge_type, earned_date
CommunityPosts: id, user_id, content, photo_url, anonymous, likes, comments
AIInsights: id, user_id, insight_text, generated_date, insight_type
UserPatterns: id, user_id, trigger_times, trigger_locations, common_foods, vulnerability_patterns
```

## UI/UX Design Guidelines

### Color Psychology
- **Primary Colors**: Deep reds and oranges (guilt/warning)
- **Success Colors**: Green (for clean streaks)
- **Neutral**: Grays and whites for balance
- **Shame Mode**: Red-tinted interface when logging junk food
- **Pride Mode**: Green-tinted interface during clean streaks

### Key Screens
1. **Dashboard**: Streak counter, weekly shame score, quick photo button, AI insight of the day
2. **Log Junk Food**: Camera → Photo → Rating sliders → Optional calorie estimate → AI-generated response
3. **Progress**: Charts, money wasted, streak history, AI pattern insights
4. **AI Coach Chat**: Conversational interface for craving support
5. **Community**: Anonymous confession feed
6. **Profile**: Achievements, settings, accountability partner, AI coaching preferences

### Emotional Design Elements
- **Dramatic animations** when streak breaks
- **Celebratory effects** for milestones
- **Progress bars** that fill with shame (red) or pride (green)
- **Before/after photo comparisons** of their junk food habits

## About Calorie Logging

**Optional but Valuable Addition**: While the core concept focuses on psychological triggers rather than nutrition data, adding **optional calorie estimation** enhances the app's value:

### Why Include Calories (Simple Approach):
- **User can manually estimate** ("This burger is probably 800 calories")
- **AI can suggest estimates** based on food photo description
- **Adds more "shame factor"** - "You've eaten 3,000 extra calories in junk food this week"
- **Creates better insights** - "Your worst guilt days average 1,200+ junk calories"
- **Increases sale value** - shows more comprehensive tracking

### Implementation (No Complex APIs Needed):
- **Manual input**: Quick slider or preset options (200, 500, 800, 1200+ calories)
- **AI estimation**: Use OpenRouter free models to estimate calories from photo + user description
- **Simple database**: Just store the number, no complex nutrition data
- **Focus stays psychological**: Calories are just another "shame metric"

### Sample AI Calorie Estimation:
```javascript
const estimateCalories = async (foodDescription) => {
  const prompt = `Estimate calories for this junk food: "${foodDescription}". Give just a number estimate (e.g., 650).`;
  // Use OpenRouter free model to get quick estimate
};
```

## Core User Flow
1. **Onboarding**: Set goals, take "starting point" photo, invite accountability partner
2. **Daily Use**: 
   - Clean day: See streak counter grow + get AI encouragement
   - Junk food moment: Photo → Rate guilt/regret → Optional calorie estimate → AI coaching response → See streak break → Get AI-powered motivation to restart
3. **Weekly Review**: Get AI-generated shame/pride report with insights, share progress, earn achievements
4. **Community Engagement**: Read others' confessions, share support
